Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems.
- The importance of software engineering is to ensure that we build reliable software, ensure that apps run efficiently and are optimized to save funds for a busines while protecting its important information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- The birth of software enginnering: Software was written by individual programmers without much structure. However, as  computers became more powerful and software projects grew larger, programmers then realized there needed to be better ways to organize and manage development.
- Object-Oriented Programming: This approach helped organize software by grouping data and functions into objects, making it easier to reuse code and manage complex systems.
- The Rise of Open Source: Developers began sharing their code freely, allowing others to modify and improve it. This community-driven approach led to the creation of popular software tools like Linux and Apache.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Planning: This is the first phase where the project, objectives, timeline, and resources are defined.

- Requirements Gathering and Analysis: In this phase, developers work with stakeholders (like users, clients, or managers) to gather and document detailed software requirements and specs.

- Design: Based on the specs provided, the software architecture and design are created. This includes the system structure, user inteface, database structure etc.

- Implementation (Coding): During this phase, developers start writing the code for the software based on the design specifications.

- Testing: After the software is developed, it is thoroughly tested to ensure it works as expected. This includes checking for bugs, performance issues etc.

- Deployment: Once the software passes testing, it is deployed (released) to the production environment and users can start using it.

- Maintenance: After deployment, the programmers continuosly  fix bugs, update the software, add new features, or make improvements based on user feedback. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall Methodology:
    -  Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase (like planning, design, development, testing, etc.) is completed before moving on to the next.
    - Its advantages are that it gives yiu a clear structure, predictable and very easy to manage.
    - Its disadvantages is that testing happens later, requirements cannot be changed anytime and there is no flexibility.
    - An example of where the methodolgy would apply is when one is creating a payroll system for a small company which has set requirments and the feature won't have to be changed in the long run or during programming.

- Agile Methodolgy:
    -  Agile methodolpogy is more of an incremental approach where development is broken down into small cycles or sprints (typically 2-4 weeks) and every sprint covers a portion of the project and is tested before the next sprint.
    - Its advantages are that it has fast delivery, very flexible and has continuous feedback.
    - Its disadvantages is that the scope/requirements could be lost or changed along the way, it will require a close collaboration and is less predictable.
    - An example would be creating a mobile app which will have its features changed based on user feedback and interactions.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A Software Developer (or Software Engineer) is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that makes up the software.

- A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets the required quality standards by testing for bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and user experience problems.

- A Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the project’s progress, ensuring that it is completed on time, within budget, and meets the project’s goals and specifications.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- They are both essential tools in the software development process as they help improve efficiency, collaboration, and quality of software projects.

- An Intergrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides developers with a comprehensive environment to write, test, and debug their code. (eg. VS code)

- A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track and manage changes to the codebase over time. (eg. Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Software engineers often work with requirements that are unclear, incomplete, or constantly changing.
    -  A strategy would be to adopt the agile methodolgy and have clear communication with stakeholders to get clarity of the requirements from the start of the programe.

- Software projects are often delayed due to unforeseen issues like bugs, scope changes, or underestimating the time required for development. 
    - A strategy would be to set a realistic estimation, utilize time management tools and prioritize high-value features first.

- Bugs are an inevitable part of software development. Debugging can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when they are complex or difficult to reproduce.
    - A atrategy would be to collaborate with another programmer, log files and monitoring and use debugging tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing involves testing individual components of the software (such as functions, methods, or classes) in isolation to ensure they perform as expected.
    - Its importance is to improve code quality, early error detection and faster debugging.

- Integration testing focuses on testing how different components of the software interact with each other.
    - Its importance is to identify interface issues, catch any data flow erros and ensure that the system is ready for deployment.

- System testing is the testing of the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
    - Its importance is test end-to-end validation, requiremment verification, usability and performance testing.

- Acceptance testing, also known as User Acceptance Testing (UAT), is the final phase of testing where the software is evaluated against user requirements and is performed by end-users.
    -  Its importance is to reduce risk, get stakeholders approval and get user-centric testing.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and crafting specific input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT, to achieve the desired output.
    - Its importance is to maximise  effeciency, improve response quality and controll output behavior.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- A vague prompt would be "Can you explain this?"
- A more improved prompt would be "Can you please explain what is front-end development and its importance in the software engineering world."
- The prompt is much more effective because it is more precise as to what the response should focus on and encorages a more detailed answer.
